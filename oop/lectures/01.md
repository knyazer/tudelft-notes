# Introduction & course related matters
In this course there are masters (transfering to CSc) and bachelor students. No other student!

### What to do
We have to enroll via mytudelf.nl (and brightsapce)

### How course organized
* lectures
* tutorial assignments (aka solidify the knowledge)
* lab assignemnts (homework)
* shared lab sessions
    + ask questions
    + TA's give feedback on finished stuff
    + TA's help if you fail (maybe?)
    + asking TA's "how to do better" or "how does this look" is a good idea
* exams - final step

**Nothing is mandatory**

Though doing everything & coming to lectures is a good idea

### Lectures
Two parts:
* listen and interact, though no laptops
* code code code

Taking notes on laptop is not really allowed

# Lection

### Languages types
* Compiled language - for specific hardwawre platform
* Java, C#, etc - compiles to intermediate representation, called bytecode in Java, and which executes on JVM
* Python - interpreter (specific program) executes the program directly

### Paradigms
* Imperative programming
    - composed of sequence of statements, where each statement is data and/or operations

* Object oriented
    - composed of objects with states that can be manipulated via methods

* Functional programming
    - composed of functions, all the data is immutable (not changing, constant), and no state concept is used

*We do not really need to know this, but on the basic level this is enough about paradigms*

### Data types
* Primitive data types (only 8 in Java)
    - Boolean
    - Integer
    - Real number (double)
    - Character
the difference in number representation is number of bits spend per variable (data piece), e.g. 8 bits, 32 bits, etc

* Reference data types
    - String (sequence of characters)
    - All other things


### Numbers
*sign ~ means approximately*

Overflow binary: 011111...111           + 000...00001 = 1000.....000
Overflow maths : MAX_INT (~ 2.000.000.000)  + 1           = MIN_INT (~ -2.000.000.000) 
1000...0000 - is the minimal possible number, not zero

##### Casting types
when you do 
``double x = 1 / 3;``
Java considers it to be integer math, so double x = integer computatation, so x = 0;

while doing ``double x = 1.0 / 3.0`` gives double maths

and doing ``double x = 1.0f / 3.0f`` gives float maths (float is like double, but less precision, though less memory)

as double have higher precision - the double maths output would be 0.3333(3 written 17 times)3334, and float maths output would be 0.3333(3, written 8 times)3334, so thats why you can see 4 at the end of floats, but 3 at the end of doubles. You just see only a few first digits.

**Always use doubles, so NO letter f in the end of the number, as we do not care about memory**

### Boolean math
A       !A
false   true
true    false

so ! operator just inverses the boolean value

&& is logical operator "and"
|| is logical operator "or"

### Symbols
In the strings you could use any symbols from utf-8 (google it if you don't know what is it)
Characters are actually represented by numbers, so, for example symbol '0' is 48, symbol 'Yen' is 165, etc. However, symbols more than 127 (including 128, not including 127) are not really strictly determined, so always check that symbol is supported by Java.

### Visibility modifiers
* public - indicates that all other classes are allowed to call this method
* protected - indicates that only children of this class (and itself) are allowed to access this method
* private - indicates that only this class is allowed to access the method

### Method definition structure
``"visibility modifier" "return data type" "method name"("first argument", "second argument", ...); ``
there is also word static, but we do not care about it for now
