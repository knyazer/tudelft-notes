# Some sort of global notes about the staff

### OOP
I have written down a bunch of questions on the papers for the oop, mostly they are related to code style and reference type vs data type.


### RL
RL course seeems more complicated then other, in rl folder there are lists of question, which you should be able to answer. There are no answers provided, so if you not sure about your answer - google it. Probably it is great to check all the answers you give.


### CO
For now seems simple, but the main idea is that to maximize final grade you should learn assembly as fastt as possible. I am yet to check that you are allowed to write custom asm compilers and that you are allowed to use gdb. -> questions.md


### Other thingies?
In each file there is a list of questions which I want to ask TA's, or maybe on the website, idk. So questions are marked with *!* which means it is ungoogleable.
